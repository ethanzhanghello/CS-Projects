## 📖 About the Project

This is a faithful recreation of the popular single-player puzzle game [2048](https://play2048.co/) written in Java. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, where players slide numbered tiles in four directions. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one. The objective is to reach the tile with the number **2048**.

This version is implemented with a graphical user interface (GUI), custom logic classes, and a clean object-oriented architecture.

## 💡 Motivation

I created this project to strengthen my understanding of:

- Object-oriented programming in Java  
- GUI development using Java Swing  
- Game state management and tile logic  
- Modular class design and matrix manipulation

Rebuilding a classic game from scratch was both a challenge and a learning opportunity. I wanted to go beyond just console-based Java programs and practice building something interactive and visual.

## 🌟 Features

- Smooth 4-direction tile sliding with merging logic
- Score tracking and game-over detection
- Responsive Java Swing GUI
- Clean and modular codebase
- Easy to build and run locally

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java
- **GUI Framework:** Java Swing
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse (any Java IDE works)
- **Tools:** Java Compiler, JDK 8+

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/2048-java.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder in your IDE.
3. Make sure all `.java` files are in the same package or update the package declarations.
4. Compile and run `Main.java`.

---

## 🕹️ Usage

- Launch the game by running `Main.java`.
- Use your **arrow keys** to move the tiles:
  - When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge.
  - Keep merging tiles until you reach 2048!
- When no moves are possible, the game ends.
